Stacks Covered:

- React / Next (Employability Stack)
- Laravel + Vue (Specialization Stack)
- React Native (Exploration Stack)

---

# Weekly Stack Routine

## PRIMARY — React Ecosystem (50%)

Focus: Job readiness + real-world skills

Mon

- React concepts
- Hooks / architecture

Wed

- Community contribution
- Debugging real code

Fri

- Feature build
- Project improvement

---

## MAIN — Laravel + Vue (35%)

Focus: Strong backend + full-stack authority

Tue

- Backend logic
- APIs
- database design

Thu

- Architecture
- validation
- optimization

Sat

- Full feature implementation
- integration work

---

## EXPLORATION — React Native (15%)

Focus: Mobile familiarity + skill expansion

Sun

- small mobile feature
- UI practice
- simple app build
- API fetch tests

Rule:
Never build large mobile apps early. Only micro-projects.

# Daily Progress Rule

Each study day must include at least ONE:

BUILD → feature or project  
FIX → debug or refactor  
LEARN → new concept  
APPLY → job or contribution

Consistency > duration.

# Stack Priority System

Never split time equally.

Recommended ratio:

React Ecosystem → 50%  
Laravel + Vue → 35%  
React Native → 15%

Reason:
React → fastest hiring path  
Laravel → strongest long-term leverage  
React Native → bonus advantage

---

# Portfolio Positioning Statement

Use this in resume or portfolio:

Full-stack developer focused on Laravel backend systems and modern React ecosystem, currently expanding into mobile development with React Native.

---

# Golden Rules

- Do not chase stacks — build projects
- Real code > tutorials
- Small consistent progress > rare long sessions
- Finished features > unfinished big ideas

---

# Weekly Success Metric

A productive week must include:

- 1 feature built
- 1 bug fixed
- 1 concept learned deeply
- 5 job applications

If these are done → week successful.

---

# Long-Term Objective

Become a developer who can build:

- Web apps
- APIs
- Dashboards
- Mobile apps

Rare skill combination = higher hiring probability.
